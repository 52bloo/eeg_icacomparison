Project code files used in paper manuscript "I See Artifacts: ICA-based EEG Artifact Removal Does Not Improve Deep Network Decoding Across Three BCI Tasks" by Taeho Kang and Christian Wallraven.

Certain files (external libraries, dataset files, ICA computed components) have been excluded for the moment due to file size and copyright considerations.
